### Zero-shot and Few-Shot
* When would you choose zero-shot?
    * We would use zero-shot when the task is simple and few-shot prompting is not needed.
* When is few-shot worth the extra effort?
    * When there are multiple ways to complete a task or answer a question, some which may be incorrect, or where some or valid but undesired.
* How did the classification output change from Task 3.11 Task 3.12
    * The classification output in 3.11 was accurate but in Task 3.12, when we changed the examples to be wrong, the classification output was also wrong.

* How did the generated code change from Task 3.21 to Task 3.22?
    * Before we removed the examples, the generated code was concise and correct. After removing the examples from our prompt, the genereated code included documentation and had a longer solution.
