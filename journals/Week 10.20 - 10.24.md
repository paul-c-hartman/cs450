### Time spent
- **Total:** 30 mins
- **Started:** 9:20 AM
- **Ended:** 9:50 AM
### Tasks attempted
1. Decide on team structure

    - *Attempted solution:* working faster
    - *Outcome:* still ran out of time haha
### Tasks completed
- [x] Decide on team structure -- no manager, split into subteams as needed for features. Subject to change
- [x] Set up communication channels -- using Discord
- [ ] Set up regular meetings -- ran out of time
### Notes and reflections
Having regular meetings set up will be helpful for us to organize outside of class. Also, I should schedule in a time slot every week for working on this.
### Next steps
- [x] Set up regular meetings
- [x] Decide project tooling
- [ ] Decide project architecture
- [x] Bootstrap application
